* CONSOLE COMMANDS <br>

    create a new request: php artisan make:request [namespace/request_class_name] a.g.list/students [ControllerName@methodName]
    TO GET MAKE THIS COMMAND WORK WE NEED A FEW CHANGES:
    * put this keyword in the end of each of your controller: '//DummyNewRequestMethod'
    * put this keyword in the end of each route file: '//DummyNewRoute'
